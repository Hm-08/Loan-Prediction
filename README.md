# Loan-Prediction
Loan Prediction using LightGBM on Loan Dataset.

## Machine Learning Pipeline
The pipeline to predict risk of loan application consists of the following stages: 
1. Data Ingestion:
- Reads a CSV file from the specified file path and returns it as a dataframe. 
3. Data Preprocessing: - - - 
- Feature engineering and selection. 
- Cleaning and handling missing values. 
- Standardization and encoding categorical variables. 
4. Model Training: - - 
- Splitting data into training and testing sets. 
- Training the LightGBM model. 
5. Model Evaluation - 
- Evaluating model performance using appropriate metrics. 
6. Model Tuning: - - 
- Hyperparameter tuning using cross-validation. 
- Selection of the best model based on evaluation metrics. 
7. Model Deployment: - 
- Saving the trained model. - 
- Deploying the model to a production environment.
